# MaxFlow-Logistics-Optimizer
•	Designed and implemented a Python program to address material shipping from California (CA) to every other state in the USA using Max Flow.
•	 Developed a graph to compute a flow with demands over a given directed graph, where nodes represent states and are annotated with 'demand' properties, and edges are annotated with 'capacity' properties.
• Successfully computed a flow networkx, ensuring that each state received the required number of movie copies while efficiently managing shipping logistics
